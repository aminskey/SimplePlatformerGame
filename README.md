# My First Python Game
## The Story As To Why I Created This Game
I Have plans of making my own game console,  
and ever since I was little I knew I could make something awesome.  
I thought out a plan a while ago, but then I thought, well why not just start with the games.  
So here I Am with my first adictive game ever.  
  
### Why Python??
Well I while ago we had a school project, and it had a lot research in it.  
It was up to me to make an app. So what I did was that I made an MVP in Python using Pygame.  
And when this thought crossed my mind, then I knew that I could create stuff like this.  
  
**To start with** I was following written tutorials, but they didn't really help at all.  
They were way beyond my understanding. So instead I searched it up on YouTube and it helped my a lot.  
I Learned about Sprites, Classes and how to use the mouse.
