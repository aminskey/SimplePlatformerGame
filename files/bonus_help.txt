You just unlocked a remake 
of the original Sky Dash game.
You must be wondering how to play it,
well if your not 
then go ahead and press the start button.

But if you are 
then you've come to the right place.
This game is about 
travelling the longest distance 
withouth getting hit 
by any sort of enemy obstacle.
An enemy obstacle would be stuff like 
lava, spike strips, seagulls 
and red cubes.
When you die your score 
will be temporarily saved, 
and if you wish to break 
the highscore then have fun!!
