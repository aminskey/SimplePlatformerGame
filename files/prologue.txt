In a world long before time<<nl<<
Lived the cubians::

A civilisation<<nl<<stronger and more advanced<<nl<<than mankind::

A civilisation<<nl<<that floated<<nl<<in the vast<<nl<<sky::

Peaceful like the wind::

Their main source of energy<<nl<<
The green crystal of life::

It was only when<<nl<<greed took over::
That the civilisation<<nl<<
fell to its knees::
::
They wanted the crystal::
But it only resulted::in fatal<<nl<<destruction::
